I wanted to test my mental arithmetic for how C interprets mathematics equations (operator precedence, truncation, etc). This application generates a fairly easy random equation, prompts the user for an answer, parses and evaluates the generated equation, then compares the result to the user's answer.

The source repository has a Visual Studio project, *but* the actual source files should also build with `gcc`.

Hopefully I got the parsing/arithmetic algorithm correct, but if not then remember this is open source, so patches welcome! `;)`
